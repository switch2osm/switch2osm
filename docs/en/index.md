We give you the data for free; you can make any map you like with it. Or benefit from the expertise of those already using OpenStreetMap.

Host it on :material-desktop-tower: your hardware, or :material-server-network: elsewhere. You have control.

[Switch2OSM](#) explains how to make the switch – from first principles to technical how‑tos.

## What people say about OpenStreetMap

&laquo;Much like Wikipedia challenged Encyclopedia Britannica and Linux took on Microsoft Windows, OpenStreetMap is battling Google Maps, and at least in some cases, it’s winning.&raquo;<br />
*Read what Wired has to say about [people switching to OpenStreetMap](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/01/openstreetmap-google/){: target=_blank}.*{: class="quote"}

&laquo;OpenStreetMap is all about people doing their bit, creating an incredible resource for everybody else.&raquo;<br />
