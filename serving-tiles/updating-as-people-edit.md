# Updating your database as people edit OpenStreetMap

We'll use "osmosis" for this, which will also install Java.  "osmosis" is a general-purpose OSM data utility, and one of the things that it can do is to update a database with recent changes from OSM.  Other options are available, such as "osmium".

    sudo apt install osmosis

(that'll eventually say "done.")

We'll use "trim_osc.py" from Zverik's "regional" scripts to trim down the updates from OpenStreetMap.org down to just the area that we're interested in. We do this so that the postgres database doesn't grow significantly as updates are applied to it.  We also need to need to fetch some dependancies for that.

    cd ~/src
    git clone https://github.com/zverik/regional
    chmod u+x ~/src/regional/trim_osc.py

    sudo apt install python3-shapely python3-lxml

If you have followed the Ubuntu instructions, you'll already have the scripts needed for the next part.  For Debian, you'll need to fetch those manually:

    cd ~/src
    git clone -b switch2osm git://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mod_tile.git
    cd mod_tile

The "openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire" script is what will be used to fetch updates from OpenStreetMap.  In there is:

    TRIM_REGION_OPTIONS="-b -14.17 48.85 2.12 61.27"

That corresponds roughly to the UK; you may want to edit it to contain different values.  You can also use a ".poly" file to define the boundary.

Also in there is:

    ACCOUNT=renderaccount

That will need to be changed to whatever is the non-root username below which the "mod_tile" and "regional" source exists.  On Debian 11 it will be different to the account that you are rendering tiles as.  

Something else to consider is that you'll probably want to edit the OSM2PGSQL_OPTIONS to refer to the lua tag transform script that you used when loading the database.  There may be other parameters that you need to pass here too depending on what you used when creating the database.  Change "/path/to/" to the actual path, of course:

     OSM2PGSQL_OPTIONS="-d $DBNAME --tag-transform-script /path/to/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.lua"
     
Next, we'll create the log directory for tile expiry logs, and change the ownership to the username used for rendering tiles (for Debian 11, this will be "_renderd").  The script must also be run as this account, and because this account may be different to where the software is downloaded, we'll pass the complete location of the script - modify "/path/to" to whatever is correct.

The parameter passed to openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire should be the age of the data originally loaded.  If you downloaded data from Geofabrik it should be what the "and contains all OSM data up" date was on e.g. "http://download.geofabrik.de/asia/azerbaijan.html" when you downloaded the data.

    sudo mkdir /var/log/tiles
    sudo chown renderaccount /var/log/tiles
    sudo -u renderaccount /path/to/src/mod_tile/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire 2020-11-14T21:42:02Z

The last line of the output that you get should look something like

    2020-11-15 23:50:16 (2.62 MB/s) - ‘/var/lib/mod_tile/.osmosis/state.txt’ saved [342/342]

That has created a directory ".osmosis" in "/var/lib/mod_tile" with details of the last imported data. 

One one ssh session to the server run:

    tail -f /var/log/tiles/run.log

On another run:

    sudo -u renderaccount /path/to/src/mod_tile/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire

modifying that like with the correct account and path as was done previously; but this time with no parameter.

If you see a message like:

    openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire: 1: python: not found

don't worry - this is just a disk space check.

The output into the log file should be something like:

    [2020-11-15 23:58:28] 3850 start import from seq-nr 4283484, replag is 1 day(s) and 2 hour(s)
    [2020-11-15 23:58:28] 3850 downloading diff
    [2020-11-15 23:59:31] 3850 filtering diff
    [2020-11-15 23:59:58] 3850 importing diff
    [2020-11-16 00:01:23] 3850 expiring tiles
    [2020-11-16 00:01:23] 3850 Done with import

The "replag" value shown is the replication lag; by default an hours-worth of data is taken in at a time. If this doesn't work properly check that "osmosis" is correctly installed and you can run it from the command line.

Run "openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire" again in the same way; you should see that "replag" is an hour less than it was. 

Next, we'll set up "openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire" in crontab to run every few minutes.  We'll want this to run from the crontab of the user that does the rendering, so on Debian 11 we'll need to do this:

    sudo -u _renderd crontab -e

You may see a message "problems with history file" - don't worry if you do.  On non-Debian 11 systems we will probably be able to run "crontab -e" directly from the username that is rendering tiles.  The first time you run "crontab -e" you may be asked to choose an editor. Go down to the end of the file. Lines starting with "#" are comments. The last comment line is: 

    # m h  dom mon dow   command

These fields are "minutes", "hours", "day of month", "month", "day of week" and "comand". We'll add the following line:

   */5  * *   *   *     /home/renderaccount/src/mod_tile/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire

so that the script runs every 5 minutes. Replace "renderaccount" with the username below which the script is located. Monitor the output with "tail -f /var/log/tiles/run.log" and wait 5 minutes. Eventually it'll catch up, and new edits to OpenStreetMap will appear in your tiles too.

## Potential Problems with updates

If an error such as "Expiry failed" appears in "/var/log/tiles/run.log" then the likely problem is that "render_expired", one of the programs called from within there, has run out of memory. If that is the case, reduce EXPIRY_MAXZOOM in the script until it works. You can get more details about what has gone wrong from the other files in "/var/log/tiles/".
