# Updating your database as people edit OpenStreetMap using osm2pgsql

Every day there are millions of new map updates so to prevent a map becoming "stale" you can refresh the data used to create map tiles regularly.

Using osm2pgsql (version 1.4.2 or above) it's now much easier to do this than it was previously.  Version 1.6.0 is distributed as part of Ubuntu 22.04; version 1.8.0 as part of Debian 12; version 1.11.0 as part of Ubuntu 24.04, and it can also be obtained by following [these instructions](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/install.html).  With osm2pgsql comes [osm2pgsql-replication](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#updating-an-existing-database) - that provides a relatively simple way to keep a database up to date.  A more flexible approach is to call PyOsmium directly - see [this guide](/serving-tiles/updating-as-people-edit-pyosmium/) for how to do that.

It's possible to set up replication from many different sources.  OpenStreetMap itself provides minutely, hourly and daily updates, and other sources such as Geofabrik can provide daily updates that match the regional data extracts available at [download.geofabrik.de](http://download.geofabrik.de/index.html).

## A worked example using Geofabrik data

In this example we'll download the data for London from Geofabrik, load a database with it, and then set up updates to it.  The updates from Geofabrik will be limited to the region that you have downloaded and will be made available once per day.

First, from whichever non-root account you are using, download the data:

    (if it doesn't already exist) mkdir ~/data
    cd ~/data
    wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england/greater-london-latest.osm.pbf

Next, load the database.  The numbers here for processes and memory can be varied to match the system being used:

    sudo -u _renderd osm2pgsql -d gis --create --slim  -G --hstore --tag-transform-script ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.lua -C 3000 --number-processes 4 -S ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style ~/data/greater-london-latest.osm.pbf

Important note - the tile expiry script used below assumes that tiles are written below <code>"/var/cache/renderd/"</code>.  If <code>"/etc/renderd.conf"</code> specifies another location, you'll need to modify it before expiring tiles using the scripts you're going to create here.

Then, initialise replication.  As described [here](https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/manual.html#updating-an-existing-database) files downloaded from Geofabrik (and [download.openstreetmap.fr](https://download.openstreetmap.fr/)) contain all the information needed for replication (the URL from which to download updates and what date to start from).

    sudo -u _renderd osm2pgsql-replication init -d gis --osm-file ~/data/greater-london-latest.osm.pbf

That produces output something like this:

    2022-04-24 23:32:42 [INFO]: Initialised updates for service 'http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england/greater-london-updates'.
    2022-04-24 23:32:42 [INFO]: Starting at sequence 3314 (2022-04-23 20:21:53+00:00).

In this example the date shown there corresponds to the date visible [on this page](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england/greater-london.html) when the data was downloaded.

### Creating scripts to apply updates

Next, we'll create somewhere for expiry logfiles to be written and scripts to apply any pending updates and expire any affected tiles.  When we expire a tile we can rerender it, mark it as dirty, or delete it.  

    sudo mkdir /var/log/tiles
    sudo chown _renderd /var/log/tiles
    sudo nano /usr/local/sbin/expire_tiles.sh

An example of this script would be something like this:

    #!/bin/bash
    render_expired --map=s2o --min-zoom=13 --max-zoom=20 -s /run/renderd/renderd.sock < /var/cache/renderd/dirty_tiles.txt
    rm /var/cache/renderd/dirty_tiles.txt

The "dirty" tile list needs to be writable by the "_renderd" account that we will run this script from.  See the [man page](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/render_expired.1.html) for possible settings for the other parameters.  The example above will try and rerender all dirty tiles from zoom level 13 upwards.  A more realistic example would be something like:

    #!/bin/bash
    render_expired --map=s2o --min-zoom=13 --touch-from=13 --delete-from=19 --max-zoom=20 -s /run/renderd/renderd.sock < /var/cache/renderd/dirty_tiles.txt
    rm /var/cache/renderd/dirty_tiles.txt

which matches the [defaults](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mod_tile/blob/switch2osm/openstreetmap-tiles-update-expire#L58) that the older osmosis scripts used - tiles up to zoom level 12 are ignored, tiles from zoom levels 13 to 19 are marked as dirty and zoom level 20 tiles are deleted.  That example can also be found [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mod_tile/blob/switch2osm/expire_tiles.sh).  

Next:

    sudo nano /usr/local/sbin/update_tiles.sh

initially, this script should contain:

    #!/bin/bash
    osm2pgsql-replication update -d gis --post-processing /usr/local/sbin/expire_tiles.sh --max-diff-size 10  --  -G --hstore --tag-transform-script /home/renderaccount/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.lua -C 3000 --number-processes 4 -S /home/renderaccount/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style --expire-tiles=1-20 --expire-output=/var/cache/renderd/dirty_tiles.txt

Everything in the "osm2pgsql-replication update" line after <code>"--"</code> is passed as parameters to osm2pgsql - they will all need to match what the database was loaded with in the first place.  Before the <code>"--"</code>, <code>"-d gis"</code> just defines what database we're using and <code>"--max-diff-size 10"</code> how much data to process at once, but note that osm2pgsql-replication will actually repeat downloading data and updating the database until there is no more to process, which may take some time.  The <code>"--max diff-size"</code> determines how much data is fetched on each iteration.  The <code>"--post-processing /usr/local/sbin/expire_tiles.sh"</code> just calls our other script.

Make both scripts executable:

    sudo chmod ugo+x /usr/local/sbin/update_tiles.sh
    sudo chmod ugo+x /usr/local/sbin/expire_tiles.sh

### Making sure that you can see debug messages

It'd be really useful at this point to be able to see the output from the tile rendering process, to see that tiles marked as dirty are being processed.  By default with recent mod_tile versions, this is turned off.  To turn it on:

    sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/renderd.service

If it's not already there below `[Service]`, add:

    Environment=G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all

Then run these commands to reload the configuration:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart renderd
    sudo systemctl restart apache2

### Testing

In another session:

    sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog

or if you are using Debian 12, which does not have a "syslog" file by default:

    sudo journalctl -ef

and you should now see some output corresponding to mod_tile requests.

Run the script once:

    sudo -u _renderd /usr/local/sbin/update_tiles.sh

If there are no pending updates (Geofabrik updates for these files appear daily) then something like this will be shown:

    2023-07-02 16:57:03 [INFO]: Using replication service 'http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/britain-and-ireland-updates'. Current sequence 3743 (2023-07-01 20:21:30+00:00).
    2023-07-02 16:57:03 [INFO]: Database already up-to-date.

If there are pending updates, then instead you will see something like:

When there is a tile to expire, a line like this will appear:

    Read and expanded 42800 tiles from list.

at the end totals will be printed:

### Running every day

The script to perform the update can be added to root's crontab.  First, amend <code>update_tiles.sh</code> to do some error checking at startup, and to append a summary to a logfile only.  You can get a copy of that from [here](https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/mod_tile/blob/switch2osm/update_tiles.sh).  Again, change "renderaccount" to the name of whatever non-root account you are using here.  You can also adjust the number of threads and the amount of memory cache used.

Then add to root's crontab:

    04 04  *   *   *     sudo -u _renderd /usr/local/sbin/update_tiles.sh

This example runs once per day at 04:04 every morning.  There's no point in running it more than once per day, since Geofabrik updates are only released daily.

## Using minutely updates from openstreetmap.org

Updates are also available from openstreetmap.org.  These are for anything anywhere in the world, and will therefore be larger than a set of updates for the same time period for a region from e.g. Geofabrik.  To set this up

    sudo -u _renderd osm2pgsql-replication init -d gis  --server https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute

that will return something like

    2022-06-05 20:49:21 [INFO]: Initialised updates for service 'https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute'.
    2022-06-05 20:49:21 [INFO]: Starting at sequence 5088118 (2022-06-04 17:11:02+00:00).

The date that updates will start from is obtained by looking at the most recent way object in the database, which will typically be a little earlier than any "this extract contains all OSM data up to" cut-off date.  If that comes from somewhere other than OSM, an error will occur.  Hourly and daily updates are also available so you could also run the hourly or daily versions instead:

    sudo -u _renderd osm2pgsql-replication init -d gis  --server https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/hour
    sudo -u _renderd osm2pgsql-replication init -d gis  --server https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/day

Once initialisation has been done, set up the same scripts described in "Creating scripts to apply updates" above and test it in the same way:

    sudo -u _renderd /usr/local/sbin/update_tiles.sh

Again, note that "osm2pgsql-replication" will actually repeat downloading data and updating the database until there is no more to process, and the <code>"--max diff-size"</code> in the script determines how much data is fetched on each iteration.  Eventually, it will complete, ending with something like:

    2022-06-05 22:30:47 [INFO]: Data imported until 2022-06-05 21:45:42+00:00. Backlog remaining: 0:45:05.948787

The script to perform the update can be edited as above to output a summary to a logfile and added to root's crontab:

    */5 *  *   *   *     sudo -u _renderd /usr/local/sbin/update_tiles.sh >> /var/log/tiles/run.log

As we're updating based on minutely updates, and we've made the script check that it is not already running before trying to apply updates, we can run this more often than once per day; in this case every 5 minutes.

It's a good idea to clear the "osm2pgsql-replication is running" flag when renderd is restarted.  To do that:

    sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/renderd.service

and add:

    ExecStartPre=rm -f /var/cache/renderd/update_tiles.sh.running

in the "[Service]" section.  Then:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart renderd

It's also a good idea to use the “osm2pgsql-replication is running” flag to stop replication running when you're doing a database reimport - don't start the reimport if the flag is set, and set the flag while the reimport happens to prevent replication running then.
