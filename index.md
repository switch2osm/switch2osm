# Take back control of your maps
Do your maps look like everyone else’s? Are you paying high fees just to include maps on your website?

Switch to OpenStreetMap and discover how you can build beautiful maps from the world’s best map data. We give you the data for free; you can make any map you like with it. Or benefit from the expertise of those already using OpenStreetMap. Host it on your hardware, or elsewhere. You have control.

switch2osm.org explains how to make the switch – from first principles to technical how-tos.

# What people say about OpenStreetMap

“Much like Wikipedia challenged Encyclopedia Britannica and Linux took on Microsoft Windows, OpenStreetMap is battling Google Maps, and at least in some cases, it’s winning.”

Read what [Wired has to say about people switching to OpenStreetMap](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/01/openstreetmap-google/).

“OpenStreetMap is all about people doing their bit, creating an incredible resource for everybody else.”

Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the web, explains OSM at [TED 2009](http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html).
